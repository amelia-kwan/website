I love coding... but I also love people! I'm currently in my second year studying Computer Science and Anthropology with a focus in Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing at the University of Toronto. I'm super fascinated by language and how people communicate - and how we can integrate that into our day-to-day technology. Feel free to strike up a conversation or connect with me on LinkedIn!
