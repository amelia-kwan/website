This is my first big project! I worked on it at the end of high school. It's a scroller game featuring the player as a hamster falling with a parachute, and the goal is to collect cupcakes as he parachutes down while making sure to avoid the evil flying jellyfish in the sky. It's coded in Python using the Pygame library, and I drew all of the sprites and backgrounds by myself! I also used some royalty-free music for the background and SFX.
