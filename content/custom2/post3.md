I worked on this project just this summer after wanting to explore the hardware side of technology - I taught myself Arduino IDE and programming language, creating and designing an iPhone remote-controlled car utilizing dabble, Arduino UNO Rev3, Bluetooth Module, Motor Drive Controller and created a simple dial-controlled robot arm using Arduino UNO Rev3, and 4 servo motors.
