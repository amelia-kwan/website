I've always had a passion for writing, as well as global issues surrounding human rights, culture, technology, and politics, so much so that Journalism was actually my second choice for my post-secondary education. I loved watching Johnny Harris videos, reading articles, and debating with my friends about what was going on in the world - and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to be part of something bigger, and to produce the same kind of content I was consuming.

I started out only writing articles, and eventually became a Director managing a team of writers and making organization-wide decisions on the Board of Directors. I was no longer only writing, but also editing articles, making sure they were accurate and had reputable sources, and reviewing them and providing feedback to my team. I learned a ton about the writing process and style, as well as the impact of our articles and how it affected our readers. I'm honoured to be part of that, and to be part of an organization that voices the perspective of other young people like me.
