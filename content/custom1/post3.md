Being a tutor, and being able to mentor and teach others never felt like a job to me. Every student is unique, with their own strengths and challenges, and I loved the process of tailoring my teaching approach to each one. I've had so many amazing mentors in my own life, and I wanted to do the exact same for others as well.

This experience truly honed my communication and interpersonal skills. Building trust and rapport with students is crucial for effective teaching. It's about creating a safe and supportive environment where they feel comfortable asking questions and making mistakes. I learned through my tutoring sessions that teaching is not a one-way street; it's a two-way learning process where I grow just as much as my students. Not only that, but I also got to get creative with my own existing knowledge and how to break it down (which funnily enough, gave me a deeper understanding as well).
