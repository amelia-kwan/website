This was my first "real job", my first experience working full-time, and my first experience working in a restaurant. I loved learning about the craft of ramen, the workflow of a kitchen and its staff, how inventory is managed, and working alongside many other people to make it happen.

At Sansotei, the kitchen staff were in charge of everything in the back - from managing inventory and preparing food to dishwashing and cleaning. Starting my first shift, I was absolutely terrified I wouldn't be able to keep up during busy hours or maintain the high standard of food we were expected to deliver to customers. In one sense I was correct; there was a steep learning curve in figuring out how to prioritize, sharpening my skills, and so much more... but over time I improved, with it came a kind of rewarding feeling I'd never experienced before.

After working for a few months, I had to return to school and work part-time, and I don't think I truly understood the meaning of "time-management" until I had to balance my first year of university with work. I had to re-learn how to prioritize, to study smarter, and how to manage my stress. For a while I really struggled with the latter, and would often procrastinate out of fear of failure, but after some conversations with my manager and school advisors, and discussing some new strategies, I managed to get back on my feet.

I'm incredibly grateful for this experience and would wholeheartedly do it all over again. Besides learning how to problem-solve and adapt under high pressure, I also met some of the most hardworking people I know today. Everyone was from different walks of life, had different backgrounds, and getting to know them really inspired me to work hard. Everyone had dreams just like me and were putting countless hours to make them happen. I genuinely have a newfound appreciation for the hospitality industry, and everyone who works within it.
