      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve always had a passion for writing, as well as global issues surrounding human rights, culture, technology, and politics, so much so that Journalism was actually my second choice for my post-secondary education. I loved watching Johnny Harris videos, reading articles, and debating with my friends about what was going on in the world - and I was fortunate to have the opportunity to be part of something bigger, and to produce the same kind of content I was consuming.</description>

      <description>This was my first &amp;ldquo;real job&amp;rdquo;, my first experience working full-time, and my first experience working in a restaurant. I loved learning about the craft of ramen, the workflow of a kitchen and its staff, how inventory is managed, and working alongside many other people to make it happen.
At Sansotei, the kitchen staff were in charge of everything in the back - from managing inventory and preparing food to dishwashing and cleaning.</description>

      <description>Being a tutor, and being able to mentor and teach others never felt like a job to me. Every student is unique, with their own strengths and challenges, and I loved the process of tailoring my teaching approach to each one. I&amp;rsquo;ve had so many amazing mentors in my own life, and I wanted to do the exact same for others as well.
This experience truly honed my communication and interpersonal skills.</description>
